# Setup
- Place and secure the base plate on your surface of choice.![PXL_20240726_171028359 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfca73da-3b19-4245-977e-958e5c6d1231)
- Using  **4** of the **M5 5mm** bolts mount the Donra TA robot on the base plate using the four M5 holes at positions, **B1**, **D1**, **B3**, and **D3**. Ensure the back of the robot (the side with the wire connecters, and air ports) is hanging off the edge of the plate. ![PXL_20240726_171340038 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ae8a1f-a4d7-4da5-847c-69f93b8b0d24)
- Next, mount the Emergency Stop Button, to do this use **2** of the **M3 10mm** bolts. Ensuring that the wire and wire port on the back of the housing are facing the robot use the M3 holes at positions **A1** and **A3**. ![PXL_20240726_171819807 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2571ed44-8a6d-4d37-8796-5ba5254b516c)
- Following this, mount the Processor (Small Computer). To do this, first the base plate of the case must be mounted,First place **4** of **M3 Nuts** in the hexagonal holes on the bottom of the base plate then carfefully flip the plate over ensuring the nuts dont fall out, using **2** of the **M3 10mm** bolts and ensuring the counter bored side of the holes are facing up mount this plate to the holes at positions **B6** and **D6**.![PXL_20240726_172809157 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a0bd66-c83c-428c-97e0-58de5cdfd135)
- Next, place the Processor on the cover baseplate, then line the cover top up with the four holes in each corner and use **4** of the **M3 40mm** bolts to secure it. ![PXL_20240726_173520355 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f05899f-5ecd-49d5-ae9c-252438d9769c)
- Finally, mount the probe joystick to the plate. Place the **4** of the **M5 Nuts** in the four hexagonal holes on the bottom of the Joystick Mounting Plate. Next, flip the Joystick Plate so the side with the nuts is facing the base plate (be careful to ensure all of the nuts stay in place, you may find it easier to align any nuts that fall with the plate flipped). To finish, use the two M5 Holes at **B9** and **D9** and **2** of the **M5 10mm** bolts to mount the Joystick Plate to the Base Plate. ![PXL_20240726_173548497 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6f4d499-e027-4d6d-9a0c-db9503f3d95b)![PXL_20240726_174047473 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4bd7ae-91b8-4fad-90db-bbf4cf7f6ecb)
- To Finish the Joystick Mounting, align the four holes in each corner of the joystick with the four holes on the Joystick Mounting Plate. Using these holes and **4** of the **M5 65mm** bolts secure the Joystick to the plate. ![PXL_20240726_174230997 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85ec5dcd-e0f4-4c98-8d38-c00e60e62f79)

# Wiring
- To start, using the included wires connect the DB9 and DB25 connectors on the back of the robot to the corresponding ports on the back of the Dorna Control Box. ![PXL_20240726_174423197 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afc8314f-0252-4935-bb6b-e058c2dab81b)
- Next, Connect the black and red wires coming off the emergency stop button to the control box. Using a small flat head screwdriver, you can loosen the I/O ports at Input 0 and 24v port closest to it. The red wire goes to the 24v and the black wire goes to the Input 0. 
- Following this, connect the Dorna Control Box to your router or networking box using an ehternet cable and the port on the front of the Dorna Control Box.![PXL_20240726_174502070 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c153dec-f717-4ed9-89ac-32abbded5343)
- Last, using the power port on the back connect the cable to your outlet and switch the robot on. ![PXL_20240726_174436744 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/370d03f2-4bb8-4612-9ddf-0c51c75a4a89)
